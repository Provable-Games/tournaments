# Entry Requirements

Entry requirements let you control who can join your tournament, adding exclusivity and enabling unique playing conditions. Use these features to target specific communities, create multi-stage events, or restrict access as needed.

## Token Gating

    <p>
      You can require participants to own specific NFTs or tokens to enter your tournament. This is a great way to host exclusive events for certain communities without manually tracking eligible accounts.<br /><br />
      Currently, Budokan uses a whitelist of supported tokens for gating, similar to entry fee tokens. In the future, all tokens will be supported.

## Tournament Qualification

Budokan allows you to chain tournaments together, unlocking advanced formats such as:

- Multi-round tournaments
- Multi-game tournaments
- Multi-game, multi-round tournaments

      By leveraging Starknet and Dojo interoperability, you can create tournament structures that were not possible before. For example, you can require players to qualify in one tournament before entering another, or combine results across multiple games.

> **Note:** Chaining tournaments is a powerful way to build leagues, championships, or community-driven series.

## Whitelisting Addresses

You can also restrict tournament access by whitelisting specific wallet addresses. Only those on the list will be able to join.

> **Tip:** Use whitelisting for invitation-only events or to reward select players.
