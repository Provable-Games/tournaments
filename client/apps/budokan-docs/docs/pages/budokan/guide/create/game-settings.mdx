# Game Settings

Budokan supports fully customizable game settings for all games that implement the [Embeddable Game Standard (EGS)](../embeddable-game-standard). This allows tournament creators to experiment with new game modes, tailor experiences for their communities, and offer a wide variety of play styles.

## Why Customize Game Settings?

Custom game settings let you:
- Create unique tournament experiences
- Enable or disable specific game features
- Adjust difficulty, rules, or other parameters
- Encourage new strategies and community engagement

> **Tip:** Experimenting with different settings can help you discover popular new game modes and keep your tournaments fresh.
