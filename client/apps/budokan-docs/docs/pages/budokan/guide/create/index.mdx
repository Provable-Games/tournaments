# Creating a Tournament

Budokan lets anyone create tournaments for any game that supports the [Emedabble Game Standard](../embeddable-game-standard/index) (EGS). This guide walks you through the process, highlights customization options, and shares best practices for a successful tournament.

## Prerequisites
- A Starknet wallet ([see Onboarding](../onboarding))
- Prize tokens (if you want to offer custom prizes)

## How to Create a Tournament

### 1. Open the Create Tournament Page
- Click the **Create Tournament** button in the navigation menu.

### 7. Review and Confirm

After completing the form, you'll see a tournament confirmation page. Review all details and confirm before submitting the transaction. This is your chance to double-check the structure and any prizes.

<div className="flex flex-row">
   <p>
      Once you confirm, your tournament will be created and visible to other players. Make sure you are happy with all settings before finalizing.
   </p>
   <div className="flex-shrink-0">
      <img 
        src="/docs/tournament-confirmation.png" 
        alt="Tournament Confirmation" 
        width="300" 
        height="600" 
      />

## Best Practices

- **Sybil Resistance:**
  - Avoid making tournaments with open, free entry and a prize pool, as this can lead to abuse (multiple entries per wallet). Consider qualification requirements or entry fees to protect your tournament.

- **Submission Period:**
  - Always note the submission period. If no scores are submitted before the deadline, the prize pool will be forfeited.
  - Budokan provides infrastructure to help monitor and auto-submit, but it's wise to bookmark your tournament and set reminders.

> **Tip:** Double-check all tournament settings before confirming. Once created, some options cannot be changed.
