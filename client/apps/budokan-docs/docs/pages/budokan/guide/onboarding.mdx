# Getting Started: Onboarding

Welcome to Budokan! This guide will help you set up your wallet and get ready to play on-chain games. Budokan supports a variety of Starknet wallets, with a special recommendation for the [Cartridge Controller](https://cartridge.gg/controller) due to its advanced features and signerless transactions.

## Choosing a Wallet

Budokan currently supports connection through several wallets. For the best experience, we recommend using the Cartridge Controller, which enables gas-less transactions and seamless gameplay on the platform.

## Setting Up Your Wallet

Follow these steps to get started:

1. If you don't already have a wallet, select Controller and sign up.
2. Choose your preferred login method. The Cartridge Controller supports:
   - Social logins (Discord)
   - Other blockchain wallets (Metamask, Phantom, Rabby)
   - Passkey
3. Complete the sign-up process as guided.
4. Once your wallet is set up, connect it to Budokan through the platform's wallet connection interface.
