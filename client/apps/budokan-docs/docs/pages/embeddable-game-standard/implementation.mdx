# Embeddable Game Standard: Implementation Guide

This guide walks through the steps required for a game developer to implement the Embeddable Game Standard and integrate with Budokan tournaments.

## 1. Contract Structure
Start by creating a new Cairo contract that imports and uses the `game_component` module from Budokan.

```cairo
use tournaments::components::game::game_component;

#[dojo::contract]
pub mod MyGame {
    component!(path: game_component, storage: game, event: GameEvent);
    #[abi(embed_v0)]
    impl GameComponentImpl = game_component::GameImpl<ContractState>;
    impl GameComponentInternalImpl = game_component::InternalImpl<ContractState>;
    // ... additional game logic ...
}
```

## 2. Implement Required Storage and Events
Define the required storage fields and events as specified in the standard.

## 3. Expose Required Interfaces
Ensure your contract exposes the following:
- ERC721 interface for game tokens
- Metadata and settings interfaces
- Functions for minting, metadata retrieval, and event emission

## 4. Implement Initialization Logic
Implement the `initializer` function to set up game metadata, settings, and storage configuration.

```cairo
fn initializer(
    ref self: ComponentState<TContractState>,
    creator_address: ContractAddress,
    name: felt252,
    description: ByteArray,
    developer: felt252,
    publisher: felt252,
    genre: felt252,
    image: ByteArray,
    namespace: ByteArray,
    score_model: ByteArray,
    score_attribute: ByteArray,
    settings_model: ByteArray,
) {
    // ... initialization logic ...
}
```

## 5. Integrate with Budokan
- Test minting game tokens via Budokan tournament flows
- Ensure metadata and events are correctly emitted and indexed
- Register your game contract with Budokan for tournament use

## 6. Test and Deploy
- Thoroughly test your contract for compatibility and security
- Deploy to Starknet and register with Budokan

By following these steps, your game will be fully compatible with the Budokan tournament system and the Embeddable Game Standard.
