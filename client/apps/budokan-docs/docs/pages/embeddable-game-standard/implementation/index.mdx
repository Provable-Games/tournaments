# Embeddable Game Standard: Implementation Guide

This guide walks through the steps required for a game developer to implement the 
Embeddable Game Standard and integrate with Budokan tournaments as well as any other meta apps.

## 1. Contract Structure
Start by creating a new Cairo contract that imports and uses the `game_component` module from Budokan.

```cairo
use tournaments::components::game::game_component;

#[dojo::contract]
pub mod MyGame {
    component!(path: game_component, storage: game, event: GameEvent);
    #[abi(embed_v0)]
    impl GameComponentImpl = game_component::GameImpl<ContractState>;
    impl GameComponentInternalImpl = game_component::InternalImpl<ContractState>;
    // ... additional game logic ...
}
```

## 2. Implement Required Storage and Events
Define the required storage fields and events as specified in the standard.

```cairo
#[storage]
struct Storage {
    #[substorage(v0)]
    game: game_component::Storage,
    #[substorage(v0)]
    erc721: ERC721Component::Storage,
    #[substorage(v0)]
    src5: SRC5Component::Storage,
}

#[event]
#[derive(Drop, starknet::Event)]
enum Event {
    #[flat]
    GameEvent: game_component::Event,
    #[flat]
    ERC721Event: ERC721Component::Event,
    #[flat]
    SRC5Event: SRC5Component::Event,
}
```

## 3. Expose Required Interfaces
Ensure your contract exposes the following:
- ERC721 interface for game tokens
- Metadata and settings interfaces
- Functions for minting, metadata retrieval, and event emission

## 4. Implement Initialization Logic
Implement the `initializer` function to set up game metadata, settings, and storage configuration.

```cairo
fn initializer(
    ref self: ComponentState<TContractState>,
    creator_address: ContractAddress,
    name: felt252,
    description: ByteArray,
    developer: felt252,
    publisher: felt252,
    genre: felt252,
    image: ByteArray,
    namespace: ByteArray,
    score_model: ByteArray,
    score_attribute: ByteArray,
    settings_model: ByteArray,
) {
    // ... initialization logic ...
}
```

## 5. Get score function
- Contract view function to return score attribute on score model
- IGameDetails

## 6. Settings exist
- If no settings, accept settings id 0 but reject more than
- ISettings

## 7. Integrate with Budokan
- Test minting game tokens via Budokan tournament flows
- Ensure metadata and events are correctly emitted and indexed
- Register your game contract with Budokan for tournament use

## 8. Test and Deploy
- Thoroughly test your contract for compatibility and security
- Deploy to Starknet and register with Budokan

By following these steps, your game will be fully compatible with the Budokan tournament system and the Embeddable Game Standard.
