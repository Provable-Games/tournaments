# Embeddable Game Standard: Meta-Apps

The Embeddable Game Standard (EGS) unlocks powerful new possibilities for both game developers and platforms. By making games permissionlessly embeddable, EGS enables a growing ecosystem of apps to integrate, distribute, and build on top of games in novel ways. This page highlights some of the leading apps leveraging EGS today.

## Budokan: Permissionless Tournaments

Budokan uses the EGS to provide a fully permissionless tournament protocol. With EGS, games no longer need to implement their own leaderboard or revenue logic—instead, they can plug into Budokan's aggregated platform, which:
- Accepts any supported token for entry fees and prizes
- Offers extensive customization for tournament formats, entry requirements, and prize structures
- Handles all leaderboard, prize, and entry logic on behalf of the game

This makes it easy for game developers to reach new audiences and for players to discover and compete in a wide variety of tournaments.

> **Tip:** By integrating with Budokan, game developers can focus on gameplay while the platform handles tournaments, rewards, and community engagement.

## Eternum: Expanding Gameplay with Embedded Mini-Games

Eternum, a next-generation MMO, leverages EGS to embed mini-games directly into its core experience. In Season 1, Eternum introduced a new quest system powered by EGS, allowing:
- Seamless integration of third-party mini-games as quests
- Emergence of new strategies and gameplay loops
- A more dynamic, deconstructed MMO experience

      Embedding games within Eternum allows mini-games to reach a much wider audience, maximizing their distribution and exposure. For Eternum, this approach brings significant value by introducing a diverse range of gameplay experiences to their core player base, keeping the platform fresh and engaging. By integrating a variety of mini-games, Eternum can continually offer new challenges and entertainment, enhancing player retention and satisfaction.

> **Note:** EGS makes it easy for any platform to embed, remix, or build on top of games, opening up new opportunities for both developers and communities.

## Why Build Meta-Apps with EGS?

  - Offer a diverse library of games and experiences
  - Easily add new content and features without building from scratch
  - Foster engagement and retention by providing variety to your users

> **Tip:** The EGS ecosystem is growing—consider how your app or game could benefit from permissionless embedding and integration.
